	title = {Drawing and Recognizing Chinese Characters with Recurrent Neural Network},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06539},
	abstract = {Recent deep learning based approaches have achieved great success on handwriting recognition. Chinese characters are among the most widely adopted writing systems in the world. Previous research has mainly focused on recognizing handwritten Chinese characters. However, recognition is only one aspect for understanding a language, another challenging and interesting task is to teach a machine to automatically write (pictographic) Chinese characters. In this paper, we propose a framework by using the recurrent neural network ({RNN}) as both a discriminative model for recognizing Chinese characters and a generative model for drawing (generating) Chinese characters. To recognize Chinese characters, previous methods usually adopt the convolutional neural network ({CNN}) models which require transforming the online handwriting trajectory into image-like representations. Instead, our {RNN} based approach is an end-to-end system which directly deals with the sequential structure and does not require any domain-specific knowledge. With the {RNN} system (combining an {LSTM} and {GRU}), state-of-the-art performance can be achieved on the {ICDAR}-2013 competition database. Furthermore, under the {RNN} framework, a conditional generative model with character embedding is proposed for automatically drawing recognizable Chinese characters. The generated characters (in vector format) are human-readable and also can be recognized by the discriminative {RNN} model with high accuracy. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of using {RNNs} as both generative and discriminative models for the tasks of drawing and recognizing Chinese characters.},

	abstract = {Deep neural nets with a large number of parameters are very powerful machine learning systems. However, overﬁtting is a serious problem in such networks. Large networks are also slow to use, making it diﬃcult to deal with overﬁtting by combining the predictions of many diﬀerent large neural nets at test time. Dropout is a technique for addressing this problem. The key idea is to randomly drop units (along with their connections) from the neural network during training. This prevents units from co-adapting too much. During training, dropout samples from an exponential number of diﬀerent “thinned” networks. At test time, it is easy to approximate the eﬀect of averaging the predictions of all these thinned networks by simply using a single unthinned network that has smaller weights. This signiﬁcantly reduces overﬁtting and gives major improvements over other regularization methods. We show that dropout improves the performance of neural networks on supervised learning tasks in vision, speech recognition, document classiﬁcation and computational biology, obtaining state-of-the-art results on many benchmark data sets.},

The usefulness of `regular' versus `singular' classes of features is stressed. These notions are applied to obtain a graph, G , representing a line image, and also to find an `axis' as the regular part of G. The complements to G of the axis are the `tarsi', singular parts of G, which correspond to informative features of a cursive word. A segmentation of the graph is obtained, giving a symbolic description chain ({SDC}). Using one or more as robust anchors, possible words in a list of words are selected. Candidate words are examined to see if the other letters fit the rest of the {SDC}. Good results are obtained for clean images of words written by several persons},

	abstract = {The state of the art in handwriting recognition, especially in cursive word recognition, is surveyed, and some basic notions are reviewed in the field of picture recognition, particularly, line image recognition. The usefulness of `regular' versus `singular' classes of features is stressed. These notions are applied to obtain a graph, G , representing a line image, and also to find an `axis' as the regular part of G. The complements to G of the axis are the `tarsi', singular parts of G, which correspond to informative features of a cursive word. A segmentation of the graph is obtained, giving a symbolic description chain ({SDC}). Using one or more as robust anchors, possible words in a list of words are selected. Candidate words are examined to see if the other letters fit the rest of the {SDC}. Good results are obtained for clean images of words written by several persons},
