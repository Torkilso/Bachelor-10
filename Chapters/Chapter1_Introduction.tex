\section{Motivation}

Usage of digital tools in education is increasing, and testing student's performance is moving toward digital platforms. However, mathematics is a subject where most testing is still done on pen and paper. Few good digital tools exist for writing and validating mathematical handwritten expressions. By using machine learning to validate student's submission, the benefits of using digital tools for tests within the subject may improve, and therefore increase adoption of digital tools for mathematics.

\section{Problem definition} 
\label{problem_definition}

Choosing a scientific problem or hypothesis turned out to be a challenge not knowing the potential of the assignment. Learning and experiencing from previous work on the same subject led us to explore convolutional and recurrent networks. After experimentation with both recurrent- and convolutional networks, we saw a potential use case for a combination of both types of models. Therefore, the following hypothesis emerged.

How does a combination of recurrent and convolutional neural network's accuracy perform towards classifying handwritten mathematical symbols?

\section{Target audience}
Machine learning is an extremely large field, with enormous potential. We encourage the reader to be open to some technical aspects including thoughts and choices made during the project. Machine learning is quite complex and we hope to inspire students and others new to machine learning. With that said, both our report and code is meant for a reader with some knowledge about software engineering, linear algebra and numerical mathematics. 

\section{Purpose}
The purpose of this project is both to create something useful for our product owners, while exploring the possibilities and limitations of recognition of handwritten mathematical symbols. In addition, we hope to inspire further work on the subject.
