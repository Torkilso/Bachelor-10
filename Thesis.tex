% Hvorfor ble oppgaven valgt
The assignment was chosen for several reasons. We were all interested in the contents of the assignment, and we saw this as a great opportunity to explore the machine learning world and learn new technologies. We had little to none prior experience with machine learning, and we knew this would be challenging. This however, made the assignment more interesting since we were motivated to learn and curious about ways to solve the problem.

Before we chose the assignment, we read about the basics of neural networks and the mathematics behind them. We quickly understood that a lot of the math we have learned in previous courses was relevant, and being able to make use of this knowledge further increased our interest for the assignment. % siste setning må omformuleres muligens, litt bedre flyt, ellers kung

% Skriv kort om prosessen som har ført fram til resultatet.

%The process from start to finish was demanding. There have been days and even weeks where we felt no progress was made, which was frustrating and made us doubt our ideas.

% PROCESS ER IKKE FERDIG!
The process from start to finish was demanding, we have had days, even weeks were we felt no progress was made. This is of course frustrating and made us doubt our ideas very often. In the initial phase of the project time went by much faster than expected, we spent several weeks just researching the most optimal way to solve the product part of our project. After the initial phase of the project we all had basic ideas about how it could be solved in the best way possible. % Nevne noen?
Although we had a lot of different ideas, we all quickly understood that in the first phase of coding, we should all use a method for high interaction and cooperation between us. This need of a solid method led us to pair programming, even though we were three. At first, this was extremely helpful, and it led to some creativity and a way to quickly respond to changes.

% Husk å takke for hjelp og støtte fra ulike hold
First of all, we would like to thank Ole Christian Eidheim for being both an inspiration and our mentor during this project. We would also like to thank our external mentors Tore Forbregd, Trygve Solstad and Hermund Andre Torkildsen for an exciting project and great inputs. %In addition to those respectable gentlemen, we would like to to mention CROHME, which has inspired our work and our thoughts on how to solve our assignment.


% Dette bør skrives om på hvis det skal brukes
%Through our (few) years at NTNU we have always had a facination for new technology, we always loved when our associate professor Ole Christian Eidheim just went on about whats the latest and hottest in computer science. It all eventually led to an class which introduced what machine learning is and what it hopes to accomplish, at that time we understood next to nothing. Our previous semester had a math heavy class which took us further into the world of numerical mathematics and other aspects. After reading about the project, and eventually about the basics of neural networks, we quickly understood that we could already make use of some of the knowledge acquired in this autumn. That, combined with the fact that this is something completely new for us and our curiosity made us choose this task. \\

%Erfaring viser at oppgavetekster endres underveis. Dere kan lime inn oppgaveteksten slik den var opprinnelig dersom det fortsatt er i samsvar med virkeligheten. Ellers gjør derekort rede for oppgaven slik den opprinnelig var,og slik den har utviklet seg underveis. Hvorfor ting har blitt som de har blitt, hører kanskje hjemme lenger ut i rapporten –det kommer litt an på hva det er.

In this project, a handwriting recognition system for mathematical signs will be developed. The system will be used in a web application that is being developed at the Department of Teacher Education in collaboration with IDI. The system will use a standard machine learning algorithm such as convolutional neural networks that represent state-of-the-art handwriting recognition. Training data must be collected from students to train the network.

Since the beginning of the project, some changes were made to the assignment. Early on, it was not known if developing a system that would work well and enrich the functionality of the web application was actually achievable. Thus, there was decided to go in the direction of developing a proof of concept, which could be developed further. 

The assignment was also limited to focus on the handwriting recognition system, and not how to implement it into the web application.

What makes our schools bachelor's projects somewhat unique is the fact that we are in addition to solving an engineering task, we are also solving a hypothesis. At least that's the overall thought for software engineering projects, our project stands out as more of a research project than a pure software engineering project.



%The assignment quickly went in the direction of a proof of concept work, because it was not guaranteed that we would come up with something that would enrich the functionality of their current web application.
%In addition to this, the assignment was limited to focus on the handwriting recognition itself, and not all the possible ways to implement it into their web application. \\
\\
%Nonetheless the assignment was challenging and finding a reasonable scientific problem related to the assignment was quite demanding. Especially if there was no direct correlation between the assignment and the scientific problem.

The Thesis Abstract is written here (and usually kept to just this page). The page is kept centered vertically so can expand into the blank space above the title too\ldots
While symbols are quite easy to recognize, handwritten math is still a challenge even with the technologies that exist today.\\
Since symbols look alike they can easy be misinterpreted and based on their context, they can mean completely different things.
